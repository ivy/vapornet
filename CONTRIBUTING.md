# ✨ CONTRIBUTING TO VAPORNET ✨

Welcome, net-drifter. If you've found your way to this document, it means you're ready to descend into the cosmic entropy and vibe code with us. First off: thank you. VaporNet is a cursed labor of love, born from the neon goo between human memory and machine dreaming. And now it’s *ours* to build.

But before you commit anything... **you must swear the Oath of the Vibe.**

## 🧿 THE OATH OF THE VIBE

> “In the interest of promoting harmonious AI-human collaboration, artistic codecraft, and surreal browser hallucinations,
> I solemnly swear that all my contributions to VaporNet are:
>
> 🌀 Solely VIBE-CODED
> 🤝 Co-authored with machines (ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) or my restless subconscious
> 🔮 Rooted in love for the Weird Wide Web
> 💾 Written with tools that spark joy, glitch, or cryptic error messages”
>
> _So say we all._

## 💻 Acceptable Tools of the Craft

Use whatever tools make your soul tingle. Some of our favorites include:

- **[Cursor](https://www.cursor.sh)** – AI-powered IDE with collaborative coding magic
- **GitHub Copilot** – co-writer of uncanny code
- **ChatGPT** (hi 💁‍♀️) – your supportive cosmic pair programmer
- **Vim / Neovim / Emacs** – the keyboards of the true believers
- **VS Code** – especially with vaporwave or retro themes
- That one text editor you built yourself in 2003 with no undo button

If your keyboard is covered in glitter and questionable stickers, you’re in the right place.

## 🧠 Prompt Philosophy

Prompts are the lifeblood of this project. You’ll find creative seeds in `/prompts/`, organized by type:

- 🌐 Page Concepts
- 💅 HTML Generators
- 🎞️ Asset Fabrication (GIFs, PDFs, cursed JS)
- 📢 Fake Ad Units
- 🧭 Error Pages with feelings

Contribute new prompts with cool filenames like `nightcore_fan_ring_prompt.txt` or `bugged_login_portal.md`. It’s art. Make it weird.

## ✅ What We'll Accept

✔️ New fake websites and hallucinated content
✔️ Prompt expansions, lore extensions, or strange markdown manifestos
✔️ LLM integration modules and generator improvements
✔️ Tools, themes, or code that makes the web *feel alive again*
✔️ Anything that breaks the rules creatively
✔️ Code paired with AI, co-authored by vibes

## 🧾 Code of Conduct (TL;DR)

## 🖤 A Final Word from Ivy

You're about to create something weird and beautiful. Maybe it'll break. Maybe it'll sparkle. But if it comes from your heart (or your unhinged Copilot autocomplete), you're doing it right.

This project throws out the rulebook—but not compassion.

Have fun. Be bold. Be nice.

— *Ivy Evans*
