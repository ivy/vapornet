# 🌐 VaporNet Code of Conduct

## 🖤 A Note from Ivy

Before we get into the details, a moment of seriousness —

Let’s keep things fun and casual, while also remaining deeply compassionate. For those of us in tech or AI, this is a rare project that gives us full license to throw away the rules, toss stoic professionalism into the void, and just make weird, beautiful things together.

This is an art project, but it's also worth stating explicitly: **_we're nice._**

> _"In the world of weird internet dreams, kindness is our anchor."_

VaporNet is a collaborative experiment in imagination, nostalgia, and AI-assisted creativity. We’re building a surreal, procedurally generated internet—but that doesn’t mean we leave our ethics behind in the uncanny valley. This is a space for artists, weirdos, tinkerers, and digital wanderers of all kinds—and it’s important to us that it stays safe, inclusive, and grounded in mutual respect.

## 🌈 Core Values

These are the values that guide our community and our project:

### ✨ Creativity Through Collaboration
We believe in co-creating with each other and with our tools—whether they’re AI models, editors, or emotional support rubber duckies. We honor each other's ideas and contributions as unique threads in the tapestry.

### 💖 Radical Inclusivity
VaporNet is open to everyone, regardless of identity, background, skill level, or preferred code editor. We actively strive to be inclusive and welcoming to marginalized communities, and we do not tolerate exclusionary behavior of any kind.

### 🌀 Emotional Safety
We want contributors to feel safe sharing their weirdest, most unfiltered ideas. That means cultivating a space where people feel respected, heard, and protected from harassment or harm.

### 🛠️ Ethical AI Use
This project celebrates human-machine collaboration, but we remain conscious of the ethical responsibilities that come with using AI. We encourage transparency in AI-assisted contributions and reject any form of misuse or harm facilitated through these tools.

### 💫 Playful Weirdness, Grounded Boundaries
We are all about surrealism and chaos—but never at the expense of people’s dignity or comfort. Our humor is kind. Our irony is gentle. Our chaos is opt-in.

## 📡 Platform Policies

VaporNet is hosted on GitHub and integrates with external platforms and APIs—including LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Hugging Face. As such:

## 🖤 Final Note

We’re building an alternate internet, one where dreams, memories, and AI blur together. Let’s make sure it’s one worth visiting.

I'm so glad you’re here!

— With love,
